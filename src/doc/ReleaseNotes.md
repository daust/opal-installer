    - ``SourceFilesReference.txt`` (picked up by 2.validate and 3.install)
  * the script ``opal-tools/bin/opal-copy-patch-files.sh|cmd`` is renamed to ``opal-tools/bin/opal-copy-source-files.sh|cmd``
  * the patch script ``1.copy-patch-files.sh|cmd`` is renamed to ``1.copy-source-files.sh|cmd``
  * the class ``CopyPatchFilesMain`` was renamed to ``CopySourceFilesMain`` and is updated in ``opal-tools/bin/opal-copy-source-files.sh|cmd``
  * the patch ``scripts 1.copy, 2.validate, 3.install`` have all been modified, because the command line switches have been renamed: 
    - ``--source-list-file``
    - ``--source-dir``
    - ``--target-dir``
